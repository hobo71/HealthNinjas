# HealthNinjas
Tian Lan's thesis 

In this thesis we propose an effective and developmentally appropriate biofeedback strategy that teaches children emotional self-regulation skills aimed at reducing physiological arousal in the face of acute stress. 
This strategy is accomplished by embedding biofeedback into an engaging mobile game ‘Health Ninjas’ as a game intervention that targets not only nutrition education but also self-regulation of eating behaviors.
